            <span><p class="flow-text"> I've been building computers and working with technology for over 20 years. I've worked in several industries such as telecommunications, finance, travel and 
            logistics in roles ranging from Team Leader, Commissions Analyst, Quality Analyst, Customer Service and Sales. I also served as a Subject Matter Expert for 
            <span title="Asynchronous Digital Subscriber Line/Very high Bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line">ADSL/VDSL</span> service, and acted as a senior member for a
            <span title="Commonly called UAT"> User Acceptance Testing</span> team, running tests on new application releases and providing feedback to developers and 
            project managers by anticipating questions, issues and training needs that may impact when the application is pushed to production.
            I'm currently working on completing the Full Stack Developer coding program through Washington University's Technology and Leadership Center/James McKelvey 
            School of Engineering.</p>
            
            <p class="flow-text">As a well rounded individual, in my spare time I read, build computers, and enjoy playing video games as well as guitar. I'm also familiar with mechanical areas 
            such as automotive and home projects. I also have five extremely intelligent (and at times, dangerous üò±) boys. I'm an animal lover, and currently have three pets: A dog named Claire, and two cats - 
            Llama and Smudge</p>
